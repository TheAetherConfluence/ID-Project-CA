Lee Jun Fai's Work Portfolio Website Project

This is my design of a portfolio website.

DESIGN PROCESS

The idea was to lay out the portfolio in several "chapters" to break up the content to make it easier to read. The Website is made for employers looking for prospective employees to hire, and they want the information they need about potential hires to be laid out as simply as possible.

From a user perspective:" As a employer looking for people to hire, I want the information about the person to be presented neatly so that I can easily read it and quickly determine whether they may be worth hiring or not."

Initial Wireframe Design: https://github.com/TheAetherConfluence/ID-Project-CA/blob/main/ID_S10221837_Lee%20Jun%20Fai_Assg1_wireframe.xd

Unfortunately I ran out of time and had to cut down on some features in order to finish this website on time, so the initial wireframe and the final product look quite different, although the general idea is still the same.

FEATURES

Navigation Bar at the top allows the user to immediately jump to the desired section of the site by clicking on the hyperlink.

1) Portfolio with links to allow users to see my completed projects by clicking on the one they wish to view(even if it is just random links right now in lieu of not having any substantial projects to speak of).
2) Email Me Button and LinkedIn direct links to allow users to contact me if they wish to hire me.
Features left to Implement
1) Image Gallery for Portfolio
2) More Interactive Features to engage the user.

TECHNOLOGIES USED

https://www.w3schools.com/ was used to help implement several features of the website as I had barely any knowledge on how to actually code in features so I used w3schools to learn the structure of the code. No plagiarism was done as the code wasn't mass copied directly from the website, I only used the tutorials to guide me.

Visual Studio Code was used to code and test the website. https://code.visualstudio.com/

Github was used to store the website data and the README https://github.com/

Adobe XD was used to make the wireframe https://www.adobe.com/sg/

TESTING

Extensive testing was done to ensure that the website runs smoothly. The navigation bar and hyperlinks work perfectly, the images used were there, and the styling of the text and website, while basic, is functional.

On both Mobile and PC, the website is fully functional, and the mobile site safely wraps text and resizes images to fit the screen.

I received inspiration from w3schools which provided tutorials on how to implement html features.
